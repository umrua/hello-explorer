    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <!-- AI: Claude Haiku 4.5, Prompt: Can you generate a detailed description about the Earth with some interesting facts in a scientific tone?-->
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to harbor life, distinguished by the presence of liquid water and a complex biosphere. With a mean radius of approximately 6,371 kilometers and a mass of 5.972 × 10^24 kilograms, Earth comprises a layered structure consisting of a solid inner core, liquid outer core, mantle, and crust. The planet's atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), is essential for sustaining aerobic life and provides protection from harmful solar radiation through the ozone layer. Earth's magnetic field, generated by convective currents in the liquid iron outer core, deflects the solar wind and shields the surface from energetic particles. The planet completes one rotation every 23 hours and 56 minutes, and orbits the Sun with a period of approximately 365.25 days. Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, which plays a critical role in climate regulation and the hydrological cycle. The presence of plate tectonics and an active geological system continually reshape the planetary surface through processes including volcanism, erosion, and mountain building.</p>
