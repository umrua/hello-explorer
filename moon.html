    <h1>Moon</h1>
    <!-- AI: Claude Haiku 4.5, Prompt: Can you generate a detailed description about the Moon with some interesting facts in a scientific tone?-->
    <p>The Moon is Earth's sole natural satellite, orbiting our planet at an average distance of approximately 384,400 kilometers. As the fifth-largest moon in the solar system, it plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's tides through gravitational interaction. With a diameter of 3,474 kilometers and a mass approximately 1/81st of Earth's, the Moon exhibits a heavily cratered surface shaped by billions of years of meteorite bombardment. Its lack of a substantial atmosphere has allowed surface features to remain largely preserved. The Moon's orbital period of 27.3 days results in tidal locking, causing the same hemisphere to perpetually face Earth. Scientific studies indicate the Moon formed approximately 4.51 billion years ago, likely from debris generated by a collision between the proto-Earth and a Mars-sized celestial body.</p>
